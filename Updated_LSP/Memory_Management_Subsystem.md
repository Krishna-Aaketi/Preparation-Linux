# üß© Memory Management (Subsystem 2 of 10)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is memory management?
**Memory management** is the process by which the OS allocates, tracks, and reclaims memory for processes and kernel operations, ensuring safe and efficient use of available RAM.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the goals of memory management?
- Efficient memory utilization  
- Isolation between processes  
- Fast allocation/deallocation  
- Support for virtual memory  
- Prevention of memory leaks and fragmentation  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is virtual memory?
**Virtual memory** gives each process the illusion of having a large, continuous address space even though the actual physical memory may be fragmented or limited.  
It relies on **paging** and **swapping**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between virtual and physical memory

| Feature | Virtual Memory | Physical Memory |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Location | Logical (software view) | Actual RAM chips |
| Size | Large (can use swap) | Limited by hardware |
| Managed by | OS + MMU | Hardware |
| Fragmentation | Can be non-contiguous | Must be mapped correctly |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ What is a page in virtual memory?
A **page** is a fixed-size block of virtual memory (commonly 4 KB).  
Pages are mapped to frames in physical memory by the **MMU**.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is a frame?
A **frame** is a fixed-size block of physical memory corresponding to a virtual page.  
Page ‚Üî Frame mapping is maintained by the **page table**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a page table?
A data structure maintained by the OS that maps **virtual page numbers** to **physical frame numbers**.  
Each process has its own page table.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Memory Management Unit (MMU)?
A **hardware component** that translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using **page tables** and caches like the **TLB**.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is a TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)?
A **cache inside the MMU** that stores recent virtual‚Üíphysical address translations for faster access.  
A TLB miss triggers a page-table lookup.

---

## üîü What is a page fault?
Occurs when a process accesses a page not currently in physical memory.  
The OS loads it from disk (swap or file) and updates the page table.

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ What is demand paging?
A scheme where pages are loaded into RAM **only when needed** rather than preloaded ‚Äî improves performance and saves memory.

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ What is a segmentation fault?
An error raised when a process tries to access invalid or unauthorized memory (e.g., **NULL pointer dereference**).

---

## 13Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between paging and segmentation

| Feature | Paging | Segmentation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Division type | Fixed-size pages | Variable-size segments |
| View | Physical | Logical (code, data, stack) |
| Fragmentation | Avoids external | May cause external |
| Protection | Page-level | Segment-level |

---

## 14Ô∏è‚É£ What is fragmentation?
**Wasted memory space** caused by inefficient allocation.

- **Internal fragmentation** ‚Üí unused space inside allocated blocks.  
- **External fragmentation** ‚Üí free space scattered into small chunks.

---

## 15Ô∏è‚É£ How to reduce fragmentation?
- Use **paging** instead of segmentation.  
- Use **compaction** to combine free areas.  
- Apply **buddy system** or **slab allocator**.

---

## 16Ô∏è‚É£ What is compaction?
Rearranging allocated memory to form one large contiguous free block.  
Used to reduce **external fragmentation**.

---

## 17Ô∏è‚É£ What is thrashing?
When the system spends more time **swapping pages** in/out of memory than executing actual processes ‚Äî often due to insufficient RAM or excessive multitasking.

---

## 18Ô∏è‚É£ What is swapping?
Moving an entire process‚Äôs memory to disk (swap area) to free RAM, and restoring it when needed.

---

## 19Ô∏è‚É£ What are page replacement algorithms?
Algorithms the OS uses to decide which page to remove when memory is full:
- FIFO (First In First Out)  
- LRU (Least Recently Used)  
- Optimal (theoretical)  
- Clock / Second-Chance  

---

## 20Ô∏è‚É£ Explain FIFO Page Replacement.
Replaces the **oldest page** in memory first.  
Simple but may remove frequently used pages.

---

## 21Ô∏è‚É£ Explain LRU (Least Recently Used) Page Replacement.
Replaces the page that hasn‚Äôt been used for the longest time ‚Äî a good approximation of the optimal algorithm.

---

## 22Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Optimal page replacement algorithm?
Replaces the page that **will not be used for the longest future time**.  
Best theoretical performance, but impractical since future access patterns are unknown.

---

## 23Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Clock algorithm?
Uses a **circular buffer (‚Äúclock hand‚Äù)** with reference bits to give each page a second chance before replacement ‚Äî efficient and practical.

---

## 24Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Working Set Model?
Defines the set of pages a process is actively using.  
Pages outside this set are candidates for swapping.

---

## 25Ô∏è‚É£ What is Copy-On-Write (COW)?
A technique where pages are **shared** between parent and child after a `fork()`, and copied only when one of them modifies the page ‚Äî saves memory.

---

## 26Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of the kernel in memory management?
- Allocates memory to processes  
- Tracks page mappings  
- Handles page faults and swapping  
- Protects process address spaces  
- Manages caches and buffers  

---

## 27Ô∏è‚É£ What is mmap()?
A system call that maps **files or devices** directly into a process‚Äôs address space, enabling **memory-mapped I/O** and shared memory IPC.

---

## 28Ô∏è‚É£ What is memory-mapped I/O?
Device registers are mapped into the process‚Äôs address space, allowing direct access via pointers:
```c
*ptr = val;
````

---

## 29Ô∏è‚É£ What is the buddy system?

A memory allocation algorithm that divides free memory into **power-of-two blocks** to minimize fragmentation and support fast allocation/deallocation.

---

## 30Ô∏è‚É£ What is the slab allocator?

Used by the Linux kernel to manage **small objects** (like task structs, inodes).
Preallocates object caches to reduce overhead and fragmentation.

---

| `0x7fff‚Ä¶` | Stack (grows downward)                 |
| `0xffff‚Ä¶` | Kernel space (shared across processes) |

---

## 35Ô∏è‚É£ What is Address Translation?

The MMU splits a virtual address into:

* **Page number** ‚Üí used to look up in page table
* **Offset** ‚Üí added to frame base to form physical address

---

## 36Ô∏è‚É£ What is a page directory and hierarchy?

Modern systems use **multi-level page tables** (e.g., 4-level: PGD ‚Üí PUD ‚Üí PMD ‚Üí PTE) to efficiently manage large address spaces.

---

## 37Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between shared and private memory mappings?

| Type            | Description                                          |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared mapping  | Changes visible to all processes                     |
| Private mapping | Each process gets its own copy on modification (COW) |

---

## 38Ô∏è‚É£ What is brk() and sbrk()?

System calls that adjust the end of the process‚Äôs data segment (heap).
Used internally by `malloc()` for dynamic memory allocation.

---

## 39Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Page Frame Number (PFN)?

An **index identifying a physical frame** in RAM; used by the kernel to manage physical memory pages.

---

## 40Ô∏è‚É£ How does Linux track free/used memory?

Through:

* **Buddy system**
* **Page frame allocator**

---

## 41Ô∏è‚É£ What is swap space and how is it used?

A portion of disk used as an **extension of RAM**.
When RAM is full, inactive pages are moved to swap.

---

---

## 44Ô∏è‚É£ What is Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)?

An architecture where memory access time depends on the CPU‚Äôs proximity to the memory region.
Linux uses **NUMA-aware scheduling** for performance optimization.

---

## 45Ô∏è‚É£ What are ‚Äúdirty pages‚Äù?

Pages that have been **modified in RAM** but not yet written to disk.
Flushed periodically by the kernel‚Äôs write-back daemon.

---

## 46Ô∏è‚É£ What is kernel virtual memory?

The **address space reserved for kernel code**, data, and drivers.
Shared across all processes and protected from user access.

---

## 47Ô∏è‚É£ What are high memory and low memory zones?

* **LowMem**: directly mapped by kernel (typically first 1 GB).
* **HighMem**: requires temporary mapping (used on 32-bit systems).

---

## 48Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of the OOM Killer?

When the system runs out of memory, the **Out-Of-Memory Killer** terminates one or more processes to free memory and prevent system crash.

---

## 49Ô∏è‚É£ What is vmalloc() in kernel?

The **MMU** enforces these to isolate processes and prevent illegal access.

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* Virtual memory = abstraction over physical RAM.
* MMU + TLB = hardware that handles translation and caching.
* Page tables = mapping structure per process.
* Paging, swapping, replacement = performance-critical mechanisms.
* Linux uses **buddy system**, **slab allocator**, and **vmalloc** for efficient kernel memory management.
