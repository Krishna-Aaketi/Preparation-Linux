Kernel data structure defining where to forward packets based on destination IP.
View using:

```
ip route
```

---

### 18. How does Linux forward a packet?

If `ip_forward=1`, the kernel uses the routing table to decide the next hop and forwards the packet via the correct interface.

---

### 19. What is netfilter / iptables / nftables?

Linux packet-filtering framework inside the kernel.
Used for **firewalls, NAT, and packet mangling.**
Controlled by `iptables` (legacy) or `nftables` (modern).

Translates private IP addresses to public ones at the router/firewall.
Implemented via Netfilter‚Äôs **nat table**.

---

### 22. What is conntrack (connection tracking)?

---

### 23. What is `/proc/net` used for?

Exposes kernel network information like connections, routing, protocol stats, and interfaces.

---
