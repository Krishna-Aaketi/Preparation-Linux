# üíæ File System & I/O Management (Subsystem 3 of 10)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a File System?
A **file system** organizes and manages how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices.  
It defines the **layout of files**, **directories**, **permissions**, and **metadata**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Virtual File System (VFS)?
The **VFS** is a kernel abstraction layer that provides a **uniform interface** to multiple file-system types (e.g., ext4, FAT, NTFS, NFS).  
It hides hardware and implementation details from user programs.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Main Types of Files in Linux
| Type | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `-` | Regular files |
| `d` | Directory files |
| `l` | Symbolic links |
| `c` | Character device files |
| `b` | Block device files |
| `s` | Socket files |
| `p` | Named pipes / FIFOs |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is an inode?
An **inode (index node)** is a kernel data structure storing metadata about a file (not its name or contents).  
Contains:
- File type and permissions  
- Owner UID/GID  
- Timestamps (access, modify, change)  
- File size  
- Link count  
- Block pointers  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Where is file information stored?
File metadata is stored inside the **inode object** ‚Äî both on disk and cached in memory.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is a directory entry (dentry)?
A **dentry** maps a filename to its inode number.  
Directories contain dentries that associate **names ‚Üí inodes**.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ What happens when `open()` is called?
1. Kernel locates the directory entry ‚Üí inode.  
2. Creates a **file object** (`struct file`).  
3. Stores its address in the process‚Äôs **File Descriptor Table**.  
4. Returns a **file descriptor (fd)** to user space.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is a file descriptor?
A small non-negative integer indexing an entry in a process‚Äôs **File Descriptor Table** ‚Äî used by `read()`, `write()`, `lseek()`, etc.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is stdin, stdout, and stderr?
| FD | Name | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | stdin | Standard input |
| 1 | stdout | Standard output |
| 2 | stderr | Standard error |

---

## üîü Basic File I/O System Calls
`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `lseek()`, `close()` ‚Äî  
called **universal I/O** because they work on files, devices, sockets, and pipes alike.

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ Buffered vs Unbuffered I/O
| Type | Calls | Behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Unbuffered | open/read/write/close | Direct system calls, immediate kernel interaction |
| Buffered | fopen/fread/fwrite/fclose | Uses stdio library buffer for efficiency |

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between `stat()` and `lstat()`
- `stat()` ‚Üí follows symbolic links.  
- `lstat()` ‚Üí returns info about the link itself.

---

## 13Ô∏è‚É£ What is contained in `struct file`?
- Pointer to inode  
- Current file offset  
- File flags (O_APPEND, O_NONBLOCK)  
- Pointer to file operations (`file_operations`)  
- Reference count  

---

## 14Ô∏è‚É£ Where is the base address of the file object stored?
In the **File Descriptor Table** ‚Äî each entry maps `fd ‚Üí struct file *`.

---

## 15Ô∏è‚É£ When is the File Descriptor Table created?
Created during **process creation**, and inherited by children after `fork()`.

---

## 16Ô∏è‚É£ What is `dup()` / `dup2()` used for?
To **duplicate file descriptors** ‚Äî used in I/O redirection (e.g., shell pipelines, IPC).

---

## 17Ô∏è‚É£ What happens during a `read()` system call?
1. Kernel validates fd ‚Üí `struct file`.  
2. Checks permissions and offset.  
3. Invokes driver‚Äôs `read()` via `file_operations`.  
4. Copies data to user buffer.  
5. Updates offset and returns byte count.

---

## 18Ô∏è‚É£ What happens during a `write()` system call?
Similar process:
- Data copied from user ‚Üí kernel buffer ‚Üí device or file blocks.  
- Offset advanced, metadata updated.

---

## 19Ô∏è‚É£ What is `lseek()` used for?
Changes the **current file offset** (cursor) within an open file.

---

## 20Ô∏è‚É£ Can multiple processes open the same file?
Yes ‚Äî each has its own `struct file`, pointing to the same **inode**.

---

## 21Ô∏è‚É£ Hard Links vs Symbolic Links
| Type | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Hard link** | Another directory entry pointing to the same inode |
| **Symbolic link** | A special file containing a pathname to the target |

---

## 22Ô∏è‚É£ File Permissions Representation
Nine bits: `rwx rwx rwx` ‚Üí User, Group, Others.  
Example: `rw-r--r--` ‚Üí Owner read/write, others read only.

---

## 23Ô∏è‚É£ View or Change Permissions
- **View:** `ls -l`  
- **Change:** `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`

---

## 24Ô∏è‚É£ What is umask?
A **mask** of default permission bits that are **turned off** when new files are created.

---

## 25Ô∏è‚É£ What is `ioctl()`?
A system call that allows **user programs to send device-specific control commands** to a driver.

---

## 26Ô∏è‚É£ Block vs Character Devices

| Type | Access | Examples |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Character Device | Byte-stream I/O | Serial ports, terminals |
| Block Device | Block-based I/O (cached) | Disks, USB drives |

---

## 27Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Buffer Cache?
A kernel cache that stores **recently used disk blocks** in RAM to speed up file access and reduce I/O.

---

## 28Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Page Cache?
Holds **file data pages** for both reads and writes ‚Äî unified caching for file and memory-mapped I/O.

---

## 29Ô∏è‚É£ What is Asynchronous I/O (AIO)?
Allows operations like `aio_read()` and `aio_write()` to run concurrently **without blocking** ‚Äî app gets notified when complete.

---

## 30Ô∏è‚É£ What is Direct I/O?
Bypasses the page cache ‚Äî used in **high-performance apps** (like databases) that manage their own buffers.

---

## 31Ô∏è‚É£ What is Memory-Mapped I/O?
Using `mmap()`, a file‚Äôs contents are mapped into **virtual memory**, so reads/writes become memory accesses.

---

## 32Ô∏è‚É£ What are File System Mount Points?
Directories where additional file systems are attached.  
Example:
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
````

---

## 33Ô∏è‚É£ What is `/proc` in Linux?

A **pseudo-filesystem** exposing kernel and process information as **virtual files** ‚Äî no data stored on disk.

---

## 34Ô∏è‚É£ What is `/sys` filesystem?

**Sysfs** exposes info about kernel objects (devices, drivers, subsystems).
Used by `udev` and system tools.

---

## 35Ô∏è‚É£ What is Journaling in File Systems?

A mechanism that records **metadata changes** in a **log (journal)** before applying them ‚Äî ensures recovery after crashes.
Used by **ext4, xfs, btrfs**.

---

## 36Ô∏è‚É£ Common Linux File Systems

`ext4`, `xfs`, `btrfs`, `f2fs`, `vfat`, `ntfs`, `tmpfs`, `procfs`.

Commonly mounted on `/tmp` or `/run`.

---

## 38Ô∏è‚É£ Absolute vs Relative Paths

| Type     | Example               |
| :------- | :-------------------- |
| Absolute | `/home/hari/file.txt` |
| Relative | `../docs/file.txt`    |

---

## 39Ô∏è‚É£ What is the Superblock?

---

## 41Ô∏è‚É£ How does Linux handle device files?

Each device appears under `/dev` with **major and minor numbers** identifying its driver and device instance.

---

## 42Ô∏è‚É£ What is udev?

A **user-space daemon** that dynamically manages `/dev` entries when devices are added or removed.

---

## 43Ô∏è‚É£ File System Permissions (Kernel Level)

Enforced via **inodes ‚Üí UID, GID, and permission bits**.
Checked before each access.

---

## 44Ô∏è‚É£ Special Permission Bits

| setgid (s)     | Run program as group owner                  |
| sticky bit (t) | On directories ‚Üí only file owner can delete |

---

## 45Ô∏è‚É£ What is `fsync()`?

Flushes all **buffered data** of a file to disk ‚Äî ensures data integrity.

---

## 46Ô∏è‚É£ What is `select()` / `poll()` / `epoll()`?

System calls for **I/O multiplexing** ‚Äî monitor multiple file descriptors and wait until any is ready (used in servers).

| Non-blocking | Returns immediately; can poll later  |

---

## 48Ô∏è‚É£ What is `readdir()` / `getdents()`?

* `readdir()` (user) reads directory entries.
* Internally, kernel uses `getdents()` syscall.

* VFS provides a uniform interface for multiple file systems.
* inodes store metadata; dentries map filenames ‚Üí inodes.
* File descriptors index into process-specific file tables.
* Buffers, caches, and journaling ensure performance and reliability.
* Everything in Linux ‚Äî files, devices, sockets ‚Äî is managed as a file.
