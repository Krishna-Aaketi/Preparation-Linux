# üß† Process Management (Subsystem 1 of 10)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is a process?
A **process** is an executing instance of a program, with its own memory, registers, and system resources managed by the OS kernel.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is a PCB (Process Control Block)?
The **PCB** is a data structure maintained by the kernel for every process.  
It contains:

- PID (Process ID)  
- Process state (Running, Ready, Waiting, etc.)  
- CPU registers and program counter  
- Scheduling info (priority, timeslices)  
- Memory mappings (page tables)  
- File descriptor table  
- Accounting info (CPU usage, runtime, etc.)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are process states in Linux?
- **Running (R)** ‚Äì executing or ready to execute  
- **Sleeping (S)** ‚Äì waiting for an event or I/O  
- **Disk Sleep (D)** ‚Äì uninterruptible sleep  
- **Stopped (T)** ‚Äì paused (e.g., by SIGSTOP)  
- **Zombie (Z)** ‚Äì finished but not yet reaped  
- **Dead (X)** ‚Äì completely terminated  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between fork() and exec()?

| Aspect | fork() | exec() |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Purpose | Creates new process (child) | Replaces current process |
| Memory | Child gets copy of parent memory | Old memory replaced |
| PID | New PID assigned | Same PID retained |
| Return | Returns twice (0 to child, PID to parent) | Returns only on failure |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ What does wait() do?
`wait()` allows a parent process to:
- Wait for a child to finish execution  
- Collect the child‚Äôs exit status  
- Prevent zombie processes  

It **blocks** the parent until a child terminates.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is vfork()?
`vfork()` creates a child process sharing the parent‚Äôs memory temporarily until the child calls `exec()` or `_exit()`.  
‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs faster but risky ‚Äî child must not modify parent‚Äôs memory before exec.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is a zombie process?
A process that has finished execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent hasn‚Äôt read its exit status via `wait()`.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is an orphan process?
A process whose parent has terminated before it.  
It gets adopted by **init/systemd (PID 1)**.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between a process and a thread

| Feature | Process | Thread |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Memory | Independent memory space | Shared memory space |
| PID | Unique PID | Same PID (different TID) |
| Overhead | Heavy | Lightweight |
| Communication | IPC needed | Shared variables |

---

## üîü What is the use of getpid() and getppid()?
- `getpid()` ‚Üí returns current process ID  
- `getppid()` ‚Üí returns parent process ID  

---

## 11Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of the clone() system call?
`clone()` is a low-level syscall used to create processes or threads with fine-grained control over what is shared (memory, file descriptors, signal handlers, etc.).  
üß© Used internally by `pthread_create()`.

---

## 12Ô∏è‚É£ What is exit() vs _exit() difference?
- `exit()` ‚Üí graceful termination (flushes I/O, runs atexit handlers)  
- `_exit()` ‚Üí immediate termination (used by child after fork())

---

## 13Ô∏è‚É£ What is a daemon process?
A **background process** detached from any terminal, usually started at boot (e.g., `sshd`, `cron`).  
Runs continuously to provide system services.

---

## 14Ô∏è‚É£ What are process groups and sessions?
- **Process group**: collection of processes that can receive signals together (e.g., Ctrl+C).  
- **Session**: group of process groups with one controlling terminal (used for job control).

---

## 15Ô∏è‚É£ What is nice() and renice()?
These adjust **process scheduling priority**.

Range: `-20` (highest) to `+19` (lowest)  
- `nice()` sets priority at start.  
- `renice()` modifies running processes.

---

## 16Ô∏è‚É£ What are the three scheduling classes in Linux?
- **SCHED_OTHER** ‚Äì normal timesharing  
- **SCHED_FIFO** ‚Äì real-time, first-in-first-out  
- **SCHED_RR** ‚Äì real-time, round-robin  

---

## 17Ô∏è‚É£ What is context switching?
The process of saving the CPU state of one process and loading another‚Äôs state so the CPU can switch between them.

---

## 18Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of the scheduler?
The **scheduler** decides which process gets the CPU next based on priority, fairness, and policy.

---

## 19Ô∏è‚É£ What are the main types of schedulers?
- **Long-term scheduler**: admits new jobs (rare in Linux)  
- **Short-term scheduler**: selects which ready process runs next  
- **Medium-term scheduler**: handles swapping in/out processes  

---

## 20Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between user and kernel threads?
- **User threads**: managed in user space (fast but not preemptive)  
- **Kernel threads**: managed by kernel (fully preemptive, visible to OS)

---

## 21Ô∏è‚É£ How does Linux identify processes?
Each process has:
- **PID** ‚Üí process ID  
- **PPID** ‚Üí parent process ID  
- **TGID** ‚Üí thread group ID (for multi-threaded processes)

---

## 22Ô∏è‚É£ What is a process hierarchy?
All processes form a **tree structure**, starting from **init (PID 1)**.  
Each process has exactly one parent and may have multiple children.

---

## 23Ô∏è‚É£ What is the purpose of chroot()?
`chroot()` changes the root directory (`/`) for the current process ‚Äî creating a sandbox or isolated environment.

---

## 24Ô∏è‚É£ What is setuid() and setgid() used for?
Used to **change user or group ID** of a process to gain or drop privileges safely.  
üìò Example: `passwd` uses setuid() to run as root even for normal users.

---

## 25Ô∏è‚É£ How do you create and run a daemon manually?
Steps:
1. `fork()` ‚Üí parent exits  
2. `setsid()` ‚Üí become session leader  
3. `chdir("/")` ‚Üí detach from any directory  
4. `umask(0)` ‚Üí reset permissions  
5. Close stdin, stdout, stderr  

---

## 26Ô∏è‚É£ What is the ps command used for?
Lists process details such as **PID, state, CPU usage, memory usage**.

---

## 27Ô∏è‚É£ What is top and htop used for?
Displays **real-time process information** and **CPU/memory utilization**.

---

## 28Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between user time and system time?
- **User time** ‚Üí executing user-level code  
- **System time** ‚Üí executing kernel-level code on behalf of the process  

---

## 29Ô∏è‚É£ What is a signal in process management?
A software interrupt used to notify a process about an event (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGSTOP`).

---

## 30Ô∏è‚É£ How does kill work?
`kill(pid, sig)` sends a signal to a process.  
Example:
```bash
kill -9 <PID>   # sends SIGKILL
````

---

## 31Ô∏è‚É£ What is a signal handler?

A function registered with `signal()` or `sigaction()` to define custom behavior when a signal arrives.

---

## 32Ô∏è‚É£ What is process priority vs nice value?

* **Priority** ‚Üí kernel-internal value
* **Nice value** ‚Üí user-visible adjustment
  Lower nice ‚Üí higher priority.

---

## 33Ô∏è‚É£ What is ps -ef vs ps aux difference?

| Command  | Style          | Description                           |
| :------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `ps -ef` | System V style | Traditional UNIX format               |
| `ps aux` | BSD style      | Displays memory and CPU in BSD format |

---

## 34Ô∏è‚É£ What is interleaving in processes?

When CPU time is shared among processes so they appear to run simultaneously (on a single-core system).

---

## 35Ô∏è‚É£ What is preemption?

When the scheduler forcibly suspends a process so another can run ‚Äî foundation of **multitasking**.

---

## 36Ô∏è‚É£ What is time slicing?

Allocating a small **CPU quantum** (e.g., 10ms) to each runnable process cyclically.

---

## 37Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between kernel threads and user processes?

* **Kernel threads** ‚Üí run entirely in kernel mode (background tasks like flushing buffers).
* **User processes** ‚Üí execute user code and enter kernel mode via syscalls.

---

## 38Ô∏è‚É£ What is /proc/[pid]/?

A **virtual directory** exposing process details like memory maps, cmdline, open files, etc.

---

## 39Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between kill, killall, and pkill?

| Command   | Target  | Description                    |
| :-------- | :------ | :----------------------------- |
| `kill`    | PID     | Send signal by process ID      |
| `killall` | Name    | Send signal by process name    |
| `pkill`   | Pattern | Match by name or regex pattern |

---

## 40Ô∏è‚É£ What is a job in Linux?

A **job** is a process started by a shell, often in the background (`&`).
Managed using **job control** commands:

```bash
jobs
fg %1
bg %2
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary**

* Process = running program instance
* PCB = metadata for each process
* fork(), exec(), wait(), clone() = process creation mechanisms
* Scheduler = CPU time allocator
* Signals = event communication mechanism
* Tools: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `/proc/[pid]/`

```
